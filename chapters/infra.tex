\chapter{Testing Infrastructure}\label{chapter:infra}
All tests were performed in the \ac{AWS} us-east-1 Ohio region. We chose this region to minimize 
the costs, as it's considered to be one of the cheapest regions. The EC2 instances ran Ubuntu Server 
24.04 LTS Linux. Throughout all the experiments,  all the VMs were provisioned on dedicated hosts that 
are in the same availability zone and in the same Virtual Private Cloud. This is particularly important 
for network I/O experiments, as the network traffic between VMs sharing the same AZ and VPC is free of 
charge. We ran parallel benchmarks on general-purpose and compute-intensive dedicated hosts from 
the 5th, 6th and 7th generations.\\
To deploy the resources for the different experiments, we used Terraform which is an \ac{IaC} tool 
that's developed by HashiCorp and can be used to define and provision resources using the \ac{HCL}, 
ensuring the automation and reproducibility of the benchmarks. 
Additionally, we used distexprunner \cite{distex}, which is a tool written in python 
that helps write and run bash commands remotely across multiple nodes addressing them through 
their public IPs. Our experiments generated JSON or csv files that were gathered in an S3 
bucket using distexprunner. We also implemented multiple scripts in Python3 using mainly the re 
package \cite{re} for parsing raw data and csv \cite{csv} for working with comma separated data.
These scripts were essential to transform the raw data generated by our experiments into clean data 
that can be used for visualization and analysis. \\
We prepared different Amazon Machine Images (AMI) that included all the  required 
software already pre-installed (python, distexprunner, benchmarking tools and monitoring utilities).
The goal is to minimize the boot time of our instances and avoid configuration drift between runs. \\
These baseline conditions apply to both the network and CPU experiments. The specific experimental 
setups will be discussed in detail within the methodology section of each corresponding main chapter.
