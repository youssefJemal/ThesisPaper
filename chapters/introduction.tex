Thrhtroughout the last years, infrastrcutre-as-a-service has become one of the most used business models. 
In this model, cloud providers abstract the server's physcial machiens and provide virtual machines to end-users
that share these resources. This was possible thank to the drastic improvements that were introduced 
to the virtualization techonology with the intrdouction of hardware-assisted virtualization that significantly 
reduced virtualization overhead and allowed direct communicated of the guests with the virtualized hardware
interfaces of the hardware. This, however, does not mitigated, perofrmance degradation that happens due 
to resource contention between the different tenants. In 2015, AWS introduced dedicated host, that enables
cutomers to deploy VMs on a physical machines that's completely under their control. In this paper, we're 
interested on quantifying the extent of the perfromance degradation that can heppen and analyze its 
manifesation across key resources namely CPU and network.
